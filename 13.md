# Statistics Review

## Key Terms

1. **Chi-Square Statistic**: A measure of how expectations compare to results.
2. **Goodness of Fit**: A statistical hypothesis test to see if observed sample frequencies match the expected frequencies.
3. **Independence**: A term in statistics that describes a situation where knowing the value of one variable tells you nothing about the value of another.
4. **Confidence Interval**: A range of values, derived from a data set, that is likely to contain the value of an unknown population parameter.

## Formulas

1. **Chi-Square Statistic**: 
    $$\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$$ 
    where \(O_i\) is the observed frequency and \(E_i\) is the expected frequency.

2. **Confidence Interval**: 
    $$\bar{x} \pm Z \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$ 
    where \(\bar{x}\) is the sample mean, Z is the Z-score, \(\sigma\) is the standard deviation, and n is the sample size.

## Notes

- Chi-Square tests are always right-tailed.
- The Chi-Square test statistic follows a Chi-Square distribution when the null hypothesis is true.
- For a Chi-Square test, degrees of freedom (df) = n - 1, where n is the number of outcomes.
- The larger the Chi-Square statistic, the more likely the observed and expected data are different.
- The Chi-Square test for independence is used to determine if there is a significant relationship between two nominal (categorical) variables.
- The level of confidence in the confidence interval would dictate the range of values. For example, a 95% confidence interval covers 95% of the normal curve.

## Approach to Questions

1. For Chi-Square problems, always state your hypotheses first. The null hypothesis is typically that the variables are independent.
2. Calculate the expected frequencies. Remember that the expected frequency is just the product of the row total and column total divided by the sample size.
3. Calculate the Chi-Square statistic using the formula.
4. Compare the Chi-Square statistic to a Chi-Square distribution to find the p-value.
5. If the p-value is less than your significance level, reject the null hypothesis.

## Practice Problems

1. A researcher wants to know if there is a relationship between gender (male, female) and having a driver's license (yes, no). He collects data from 100 people. Use a Chi-Square test for independence to analyze the data.
2. A teacher wants to know if her teaching method is effective, so she gives her class a pre-test and post-test. She wants to know if the scores improved. Use a Chi-Square test for goodness of fit to analyze the data.
3. A doctor measures the blood pressure of 10 patients before and after they drink coffee. He wants to know if coffee has an effect on blood pressure. Use a paired t-test to analyze the data.
4. A researcher measures the heights of 50 individuals and wants to construct a 95% confidence interval for the mean height. Use the formula for a confidence interval to solve this problem.

## Step-by-step guide to approach Chi-Square statistic problems
1. Understand the problem: Read the problem carefully and understand what is being asked. Identify the type of test that needs to be used (Chi-Square test for independence, Chi-Square test for goodness of fit, etc.).
- *Chi-Square Test for Independence*: This test is used when you have two categorical variables from a single population. It is used to determine whether there is a significant association between the two variables. For example, if you want to examine the relationship between gender (male, female) and product preference (Product A, Product B), you would use a Chi-Square test for independence.

- *Chi-Square Test for Goodness of Fit*: This test is used when you have one categorical variable from a single population. It is used to determine whether the observed sample frequencies differ significantly from the expected frequencies. For example, if you want to test whether a die is fair (i.e., all outcomes are equally likely), you would use a Chi-Square test for goodness of fit.
2. State the hypotheses: Write down the null and alternative hypotheses.

3. Understand the problem: Read the problem carefully and understand what is being asked. Identify the type of test that needs to be used (Chi-Square test for independence, Chi-Square test for goodness of fit, etc.).

4. State the hypotheses: Write down the null and alternative hypotheses. The null hypothesis often states that there is no effect or difference or that variables are independent.

5. Calculate the expected frequencies: For Chi-Square tests, calculate the expected frequencies. This is usually the product of the row total and column total divided by the sample size.

6. Calculate the test statistic: Use the appropriate formula to calculate the test statistic. For Chi-Square tests, use the Chi-Square formula.

7. Find the p-value: Compare the test statistic to the appropriate distribution to find the p-value. For Chi-Square tests, compare the Chi-Square statistic to a Chi-Square distribution.

8. Draw a conclusion: If the p-value is less than your significance level (often 0.05), reject the null hypothesis. Otherwise, do not reject the null hypothesis.
